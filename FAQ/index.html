    <p>Qn1:How big are Golden Retrievers?</p>
    <p>Ans:About 21-24 inches at the shoulder, with males usually in the higher half of that range,<br> and females usually in the lower half. Weight can be as low as 55 pounds,<br> but is usually 60-75 pounds. However, there are many oversized Goldens,<br> with some individuals topping 90 pounds. Unfortunately, this heavier weight isn't good for their joints.</p>

    <p>Qn2:Where does the Golden Retriever come from, and why was the breed developed?</p>
    <p>Ans:He was developed in England and Scotland as both a land hunter and a water retriever <br>(retrieving shot ducks from the water).</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Qn3:What kind of temperament and personality does the Golden Retriever have?</p>
    <p>Ans:To get an idea of what a breed might be like, always look at what he was developed to do <br>(see the question above). Many of the Golden Retriever's characteristics -- his strong body, his energy level and enthusiasm,<br> his love of swimming and retrieving, his strong desire to carry things around in his mouth <br> are hardwired into his genes, because they were needed for a retriever to do his work.</p>

    <p>Qn4:Can Golden Retrievers be any color other than golden? I've seen some reddish ones</p>
    <p>Ans:Golden Retrievers come in only one color, but the shade of their coat ranges from reddish <br>(like an Irish Setter) to medium gold to pale cream to nearly white. It's all the same breed,<br> and no shade is more desirable than another.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Qn5:How much grooming do Golden Retrievers need?</p>
    <p>Ans:Their silky feathering needs to be kept combed to avoid mats and tangles, which can be quite painful,<br> as they pull on your dog's skin whenever he moves. The worst places for mats and <br>tangles are behind their ears, behind their front legs (in their "armpits"), and on their chest,<br> stomach, and groin. Their legs and paws also need to be kept combed, and their tail. The rest of their body <br>can just be brushed.</p>

        <li><h2>Kulfi</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> In a heavy and wide pan or kadai (Indian wok), heat 3 cups milk on a low flame for at least 18 to 20 minutes. The milk will reduce and thicken in this period of time.</li>
        <li> Dissolve 1.5 tablespoons of rice flour or 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of milk. Mix very well. Set aside.</li>
        <li> Grate 75 to 80 grams of khoya (mawa) or crumble it very well to a fine texture. There should be no large pieces or lumps.</li>
        <li> After 18 to 20 minutes, add 3 tablespoons of sugar to the reduced milk and mix well. Keep scraping the milk solids from the sides and reincorporating them into the simmering milk.</li>
        <li> When the sugar has dissolved and after 3 to 4 minutes, add the rice flour or cornstarch paste. Keep stirring while adding the rice flour paste so that no lumps are formed.</li>
        <li>After 4 to 5 minutes, when the mixture has thickened, add the grated khoya (mawa), powdered almonds & pistachios, and ½ teaspoon cardamom powder (or about 4 green cardamoms crushed in a mortar-pestle).</li>
        <li>Stir very well and simmer for a minute or two on a low heat. Keep stirring so that the khoya (evaporated milk solids) is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Switch off the heat. Add 1 teaspoon rose water or kewra water (pandanus water) and crushed saffron – about 25 to 30 saffron strands that have been crushed.</li>
        <li> Let the mixture cool at room temperature, then pour the mixture in kulfi moulds, serving bowls, a tray or in shot glasses. Be sure to scrape the milk solids from the sides of the pan and add them to the mixture.</li>
        <li> Cover with lids or aluminum foil and freeze overnight or for a day until the kulfi is frozen and set.</li>
        <li> Once the kulfi is frozen solid, unmould it by sliding a butter knife at the edges, rubbing the mould between your palms or dipping the mould in warm water to loosen it.</li>

        <li><h2>Dalgona Coffee</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small to medium size mixing bowl, take 1 tablespoon instant coffee and 3 tablespoons sugar.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of boiling water in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix and then begin to beat the coffee.</li>
        <li>Use two ways of beating the coffee. First beat clockwise and then use vertical zig-zag motions. Alternate between the two. If the bowl is small, then slightly tilt the bowl and beat.</li>
        <li>The coffee consistency after a total of 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>After continuing to beat for further 3 minutes, this is the coffee consistency.</li>
        <li> The final consistency after beating further for 5 minutes, which is like whipped cream. You will see that the color has also lightened.</li>
        <li>A quicker option, add the coffee, hot water and sugar in a small blender or mixer-grinder jar. Blend till you get the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Take 2 to 3 ice cubes (optional) in two mugs or glasses. Divide 1.5 cups milk between both the glasses.</li>
        <li>Spoon the creamy whipped coffee on top.</li>
        <li> Sprinkle some cocoa powder on top and serve. Stir and then sip!</li>

    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Vannila Milkshake</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>First add 4 cups of vanilla ice cream to a blender jar. This is approximately about 12 small to medium-sized ice cream scoops.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 cup of chilled or cold whole milk.</li>
        <li>Add sugar to taste. Usually about 2 to 3 teaspoons is just right, depending on how sweet the ice cream is.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of real vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean pod.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour into 2 large or 3 small glasses. Garnish the vanilla shake with your favorite toppings and serve right away.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><h2>White Sauce Pastha</h2></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a saucepan. Keep the heat to low and add 2 tablespoons butter. You can use salted or unsalted butter.</li>
        <li> When the butter melts and starts to bubble, add 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour (atta) or choose to swap 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida) with the whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>Using a wired whisk, stir the flour quickly as soon as you add it. Keep stirring so that no lumps are formed. The frequent stirring helps the flour to cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Keep heat on low and pour 1 cup cold or chilled milk in a gentle stream with one hand and stir the sauce mixture with the other.</li>
        <li>Stir frequently, while the milk heats up.</li>
        <li>On low heat, simmer the sauce till it thickens. When the sauce has thickened well and coats the back of a spoon, turn off the heat.</li>
        <li> Remove the saucepan from the heat and place on the kitchen countertop.</li>
        <li>Mix very well and set aside. Keep in mind that the sauce will thicken as it cools, so keep the consistency accordingly.</li>
        <li>Boil 4 cups water with ½ teaspoon salt in a pan.</li>
        <li>When the water comes to a boil, add 1 cup penne pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta on a medium to high heat.</li>
        <li>When the pasta gets done to an al dente texture, turn off the heat. For a more softer texture, cook the pasta a little longer. Strain the pasta with a large strainer spoon.</li>
        <li>Then, add the cooked penne pasta to the prepared white sauce.</li>
        <li> Add ¼ teaspoon each of dried oregano, dried basil and dried thyme. Or add your choice of herbs.</li>
        <li> Mix very well.</li>
        <li> Serve White Sauce Pasta garnished with some fresh herbs like parsley, cilantro, basil, chives or dill. You can also garnish with some grated cheddar cheese.</li>
